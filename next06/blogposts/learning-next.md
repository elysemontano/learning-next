For three years, I have been utilizing React as my go to for front end development. React has so many advantages and I have explored working with both class based components and functional components.

I am one who likes to learn new concepts, new tools, new frameworks. With so many options out there, I opted to dig into Next.js due to it's extreme popularity, flexibility and scalability for not only front end applications, but also full stack applications as well.

Some fascinating differences from React to Next.js include:

- Routing
- File structures
- Client side rendering versus static site rendering

There are many pieces to the puzzle of learning Next.js. but so far I have found it to be a great experience filled with many great features to expand into.
