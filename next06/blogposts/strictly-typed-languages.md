A few years ago, I started my journey into development by starting the Harvard CS50 course that jumps you right into learning C++. The first few lectures went pretty well, and then I hit for loops. I ended up hitting the pause button and took a break from learning C++ and opted to enroll in a full time coding boot camp instead of completing the CS50 course. I was able to catch on to writing for loops and more with JavaScript, and later learned Ruby as well. Eventually, I decided to look at languages that are strictly typed like C++, Java, and now Typescript. 

To be honest, at first, I was not a huge fan of strictly typed languages as it felt like it made my code look bulky and redundant. But as I have explored it more, I have found it to be much more efficient at communicating intent in your code. When creating variables, you have to think about the purpose of the variable before using it. Thinking ahead to the goal and purpose behind things is at the root of development. We also need to be clear with our intent by declaring variables with clear names so that future you, and your coworkers know what the code is communicating.
